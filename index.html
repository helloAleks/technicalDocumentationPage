<header>Data Communication And Computer Network</header>

  <p>Data communications refers to the transmission of this digital data between two or more computers and a computer network or data network is a telecommunications network that allows computers to exchange data.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
<p>Message: A message is a piece of information that is to be transmitted from one person to another. It could be a text file, an audio file, a video file, etc.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p>
Sender: It is simply a device that sends data messages. It can be a computer, mobile, telephone, laptop, video camera, or workstation, etc.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Receiver: It is a device that receives messages. It can be a computer, telephone mobile, workstation, etc.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
<p>Transmission Medium / Communication Channels: Communication channels are the medium that connect two or more workstations. Workstations can be connected by either wired media or wireless media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set of rules (Protocol): When someone sends the data (The sender), it should be understandable to the receiver also otherwise it is meaningless. For example, Rakesh sends a message to Chetan. If Rakesh writes in Hindi and Chetan cannot understand Hindi, it is a meaningless conversation.</p>

  <p>A computerised accounting system is an accounting
information system that processes the financial
transactions and events as per Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) to produce reports as
per user requirements. Every accounting system,
manual or computerised, has two aspects. First, it
has to work under a set of well-defined concepts
called accounting principles. Another, that there is
a user -defined framework for maintenance of
records and generation of reports.
In a computerised accounting system, the framework
of storage and processing of data is called operating
environment that consists of hardware as well as software
in which the accounting system, works. The type of the
accounting system used determines the operating
environment. Both hardware and software are
interdependent. The type of software determines the
structure of the hardware. Further, the selection of
hardware is dependent upon various factors such as
the number of users, level of secrecy and the nature of
various activities of functional departments in an
organisation.

       <header>Object Oriented Programming Language</header>

         <p>Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.</p>
         <ul>
  <li>OOP is faster and easier to execute.</li>
<li>OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.</li>
<li>OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.</li>
<li>OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.</li>

       <header>Internet And Web Development</header>
       <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.</p>
       <p>The Internet is a vast network of computers, and servers, which communicate with each other. The internet connects the whole wide world together. The Internet is a vast network that connects billions of computers and other electronic devices all around the world. You can get nearly any information, communicate with anyone on the globe, and do a lot more with the Internet. All of this is possible by connecting a computer to the Internet, generally known as going online. When someone says a computer is online, they are simply referring to the fact that it is linked to the Internet. How does it actually work at a very low level? </p>

       <header>Numerical Analysis And Statistical Method</header>
       <p>Statistical and numerical analysis are among the most important applications in scientific and engineering programming. This chapter describes algorithms for basic descriptive statistics and for some standard problems in numerical analysis, including: mean, standard deviation, and linear regression.</p>
       <p>Numerical Analysis is the Mathematics branch responsible for designing effective ways to find numerical solutions to complex Mathematical problems. Most Mathematical problems from science and engineering are very complex and sometimes cannot be solved directly. Therefore, measuring a complex Mathematical problem is very important to make it easier to solve. Due to the great advances in computational technology, numeracy has become very popular and is a modern tool for scientists and engineers. As a result many software programs are being developed such as Matlab, Mathematica, Maple etc. the most difficult problems in an effective and simple way. These softwares contain functions that use standard numeric methods, in which the user can bypass the required parameters and obtain the results in a single command without knowing the numerical details.</p>

<p>
The Numerical Analysis method is mainly used in the area of Mathematics and Computer Science that creates, analyzes, and implements algorithms for solving numerical problems of continuous Mathematics. Such types of problems generally originate from real-world applications of algebra, geometry and calculus, and they also involve variables that vary continuously. These problems occur throughout the natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, medicine, and the field of business. Introduction of Numerical Analysis during the past half-century, the growth in power and availability of digital computers has led to the increasing use of realistic Mathematical models in science and engineering. Here we will learn more about numerical method and analysis of numerical methods.</p>

       <header>Operating System</header>
        <p>An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API).</p>
        <p>An operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently. </p>
<p>
An operating system is a software that manages computer hardware. The hardware must provide appropriate mechanisms to ensure the correct operation of the computer system and to prevent user programs from interfering with the proper operation of the system. </p>

 <section class="main-section" id="Computer_Organization">
       <header>Computer Organization</header>
       <p>Computer Organization is concerned with the structure and behaviour of a computer system as seen by the user. It acts as the interface between hardware and software. It deals with the components of a connection in a system.</p>
       <p>
Basic Terminology:
<p>
Control Unit –
A control unit (CU) handles all processor control signals. It directs all input and output flow, fetches the code for instructions and controlling how data moves around the system.
</p>
<p>
Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) –
The arithmetic logic unit is that part of the CPU that handles all the calculations the CPU may need, e.g. Addition, Subtraction, Comparisons. It performs Logical Operations, Bit Shifting Operations, and Arithmetic Operation.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="Database_Management_System">
       <header>Database Management System</header>
       <p>A database management system (or DBMS) is essentially nothing more than a computerized data-keeping system. Users of the system are given facilities to perform several kinds of operations on such a system for either manipulation of the data in the database or the management of the database structure itself.</p>
       <p>Database Management System or DBMS in short refers to the technology of storing and retrieving usersí data with utmost efficiency along with appropriate security measures. This tutorial explains the basics of DBMS such as its architecture, data models, data schemas, data independence, E-R model, relation model, relational database design, and storage and file structure and much more.</p>
<p>
Why to Learn DBMS?
Traditionally, data was organized in file formats. DBMS was a new concept then, and all the research was done to make it overcome the deficiencies in traditional style of data management. A modern DBMS has the following characteristics −</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Real-world entity − A modern DBMS is more realistic and uses real-world entities to design its architecture. It uses the behavior and attributes too. For example, a school database may use students as an entity and their age as an attribute.
</li>
<li>
Relation-based tables − DBMS allows entities and relations among them to form tables. A user can understand the architecture of a database just by looking at the table names.
</li>
<li>
Isolation of data and application − A database system is entirely different than its data. A database is an active entity, whereas data is said to be passive, on which the database works and organizes. DBMS also stores metadata, which is data about data, to ease its own process.
